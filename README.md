# Residual Algorithms

Construct the agent which trains using the residual algorithm on the grid world and the mountain car environments.

Construct the Mean return vs episode plots for each of the settings:
1. Residual algorithm with epoch training mode on Gridworld
2. Residual algorithm with epoch training mode on Mountain Car
3. Residual algorithm with incremental learning (uses traces) mode on Gridworld
4. Residual algorithm with incremental learning (uses traces) mode on Mountain Car.
